1.0.1 / 2012-11-07

* Bug fixes

  * Fix incorrect gem description

1.0.0 / 2012-11-07

* Breaking changes (well, not really)

  * Not using INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE for MySQL!

* Enhancements

  * Replaced ON DUPLICATE KEY with a true merge function (procedure)
  * Simplified code - buffering is no longer used anywhere
  * Clarified documentation

* Bug fixes

  * MySQL upserts won't fail if you have a multi-key selector and no multi-column UNIQUE index to cover them (https://github.com/seamusabshere/upsert/issues/6)

0.5.0 / 2012-09-21

* Breaking changes (well, not really)

  * "document" (as in the second argument to #row) has been renamed to "setter"!

* Bug fixes

  * If you say upsert({:name => 'Jerry', :color => 'red'}), make sure that it only affects rows really meeting those conditions
  * Always sort selector and setter keys - i.e., column names - before doing anything with them
  * Support PostgreSQL 9.1+
  * Support MRI 1.8

* Enhancements

  * Slightly faster benchmarks for SQlite3 and MySQL
  * Slightly slower on PostgreSQL (probably because the merge function requires more arguments), but more accurate
  * Slightly clearer code structure
  * Use bind parameters instead of quoting for PostgreSQL and SQLite3.
  * Provide Upsert.clear_database_functions(connection) (currently only for PostgreSQL)
  * Don't subclass String for Upset::Binary... hopefully save some strcpy()s?

0.4.0 / 2012-09-04

* Bug fixes

  * Don't raise TooBig - rely on Mysql2 to complain about oversized packets

* Enhancements

  * Re-use PostgreSQL merge functions across connections, even outside of batch mode. Huzzah!
  * For MySQL, increase speed for one-off upserts by not checking packet size
  * Allow configuring Upsert.logger. Defaults to Rails.logger or Logger.new($stderr). If you set env var UPSERT_DEBUG=true then it will set log level to debug.

0.3.4 / 2012-07-03

* Bug fixes

  * Allow upserting by auto-increment primary key (thanks @atandrau https://github.com/seamusabshere/upsert/issues/3)

* Enhancements

  * Make setter an optional argument

0.3.3 / 2012-06-26

* Bug fixes

  * Properly quote table names - don't assume that everybody has ANSI_QUOTES turned on in MySQL :)

0.3.2 / 2012-06-22

* Enhancements

  * Make sure ::PGconn is recognized as ::PG::Connection (thanks @joevandyk https://github.com/seamusabshere/upsert/issues/2)

0.3.1 / 2012-06-21

* Bug fixes

  * On PostgreSQL, stop nullifying columns that weren't even involved in the upsert
  * On SQLite, properly join WHERE conditions with ' AND ' instead of ','

0.3.0 / 2012-06-21

* Enhancements

  * Remove all the sampling - just keep a cumulative total of sql bytes as we build up an ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE query.
  * Deprecate Upsert.stream in favor of Upsert.batch (but provide an alias for backwards compat)

0.2.2 / 2012-06-21

* Bug fixes

  * Correct and simplify how sql length is calculated when batching MySQL upserts.

0.2.1 / 2012-06-21

* Enhancements

  * Added support for Ruby 1.8.7
